## Implementation-Only Change

This change contains no requirement-level modifications. All changes are implementation fixes and UX improvements that maintain existing behavior:

- Backend bug fixes (TypeError in repository method calls)
- UX enhancements (auto-discovery trigger, form field styling)

No new capabilities are introduced and no existing requirements are modified.
